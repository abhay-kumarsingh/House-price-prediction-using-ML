In the past, property prices were determined manually, leading to a significant error rate of 25%, resulting in financial losses. However, recent advances in technology have transformed this process. Machine learning has emerged as a leading technology, where data plays a crucial role in training predictive models. The rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning is driving automation across industries. However, these models cannot function without sufficient data, which is derived from past experiences to forecast future outcomes.

The demand for housing is steadily increasing as the global population grows. This is particularly evident in urban areas, where people migrate in search of better job opportunities. This migration trend causes a spike in housing demand, leading to a greater need for accurate property pricing. Individuals unfamiliar with the actual market value of a property can suffer financial losses due to inaccurate assessments.

To address this issue, the project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to predict house prices. These algorithms include Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, K-Means Regression, and Random Forest Regression. A dataset is split into two parts, with 80% used for training and the remaining 20% for testing. The process involves various techniques such as feature selection, label assignment, data reduction, and transformation, including attribute combinations and correlation analysis. This demonstrates that house price prediction is a growing field of study requiring advanced machine learning expertise.

The proposed model, titled 'House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning,' aims to help individuals estimate the sales price of a house based on various features such as location, fireplace, road access, zone, condition, and more. The model uses Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms to predict house prices accurately. This approach not only assists individuals in making informed decisions but also benefits businesses by streamlining their property valuation processes, ultimately contributing to increased efficiency and profitability.
